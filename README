This is part of a students work from Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade.

The purpose of the project is, by using elfutils libraries for reading ELF and DWARF data,
to make a DWARF checker (dwarfcheck tool) that will try to find bugs in
debug sections of a generated code by using various compilers.


Build the project:

mkdir build
cd build
../VS-2018/configure
make

Run the tool:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/$PATH_TO_PROJ_BUILD_DIR/libdw/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./dwarflint/dwarfcheck --help
WE ARE RUNNING dwarfcheck !!!!!
Usage: dwarfcheck [OPTION...] FILE...
Pedantic checking of DWARF stored in ELF files.

     --check-debug-lines    Report bugs (if any) for generated debug lines
                            in .debug_lines DWARF section.
     --check-debug-vars     Report bugs (if any) for generated debug locations
                            in .debug_loc or .debug_info DWARF sections about
                            variables.

     --usage                Give a short usage messageReport bugs to https://sourceware.org/bugzilla
