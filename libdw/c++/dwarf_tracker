    /* We maintain the current path down the logical DIE tree from the CU
       as a stack of iterators pointing to the DIE at each level.

       Note that the path to a DIE includes the iterator to that DIE
       itself as the last element.  This is necessary to permit sharing
       our _m_seen cache across CUs.  That sharing is useful when CUs
       might share children (i.e. they use DW_TAG_imported_unit).
       But when they do, then the "construct a derived tracker that
       jump-starts a walk" case for following a reference might be for
       a reference to another CU than the one the base tracker is
       walking (_m_root).  When path_to finds the "context" path to the
       referent, the iterator that jump-starts a new walk must be an
       iterator pointing to the referent, but must be an iterator
       somewhere in the _m_root CU's tree, not another CU's.

       NOTE!!! XXX
       This scenario means we can have a die_path in our _m_seen that
       is not from our current _m_root CU.  This is only safe as long
       as we are sure that we have already completely walked the other
       CU that die_path came from so all its entries are in _m_seen.
       This ensures that a derived tracker that jump-starts its walk at
       a path in another CU will never actually have to do any walking.
       If it ever walked, it could go awry failing to recognize the end
       of its CU's children list--it's not _m_root->children ().end ().
       If we want to generalize dwarf_path_finder so it can be used as
       a generic cache when we might not have walked whole CUs, then we
       need to change things.  We'd have to store _m_root along with
       _m_path in _m_seen so that a derived tracker made from path_to
       "context" can use the right _m_root.

	 A difference in the sharing vs duplication of DIEs between the
	 left-hand and right-hand sides could mean that one side's chain of
	 references reaches the same cycle sooner than the other's.

	 Consider:

	 	A1 -> A2 -> ... -> A1' -> A2 ...
	 	B1 -> B2 -> ... -> B1  -> B2 ...

	 Here A1' is an identical copy of A1, duplicated in the A object.
	 Otherwise A1 matches B1, A2 matches B2, etc.  The B walk started
	 at B1 and hits it again at the step comparing B1 to A1'.  But the
	 A walk has not hit A1 again yet (and perhaps it never will), so
	 our test above does not match.

	 This is the simplest example.  There might be more steps of the
	 reference chain that have duplicates on one side but have been
	 consolidated to a single entry on the other.  There can also be
	 multiple reference attributes at each node that differ on this
	 issue, making all manner of tangled graphs that all really match
	 the same simpler graph (and thus each other).

	 Now we start recording the state of the right-hand side reference
	 chain walk, and keep going.  When the right-hand side then becomes
	 circular, we check that it has coincided with the left-hand side.

	 This is guaranteed to terminate, at least.  It should never have
	 any false positives, since that continuing walk would eventually
	 find the differences.  We hope it doesn't have any false negatives
	 either, but to be sure of that would require more graph theory
	 than your humble writer can bring to bear.  */
